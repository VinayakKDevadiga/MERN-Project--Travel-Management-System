Here I used 4 technologies They are MERN stack <br>
<h3>MongoDB</h3> for Data Store <br>
<h3>Express.js</h3> as backend Framework <br>
<h3>Rect.js</h3> as frontEnd Library <br>
<h3>Node.js</h3> as Runtime Environment for Javascript. <br> <br>

and we have to fill following details.<br><br>

PORT=5002 <br>
conn_string="specify your MongoDB connection string" <br>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECERT="xyz123 this is for security you can add more secure " <br>

<h2># for admin login</h2>
USERNAME1="you have to specify any admin username" <br>
PASSWORD="password for admin" <br> <br>

Step 2: <br>
install al dependencies both for server and the client( here its name is navbar) <br>
